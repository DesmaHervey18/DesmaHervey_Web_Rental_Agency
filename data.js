                as the 74.4 inches of width are expected to be seen on the production model with minimal differences.\

                a coupe descriptor to sedans throughout history, the modern definition still calls for two doors.\
                Regardless, the CLS is a sensational piece. The new car removes creases and streaks from the body panels,\
                instead opting for a smoothness that swells and contracts like a Coke bottle. The CLS appears to stretch \
                from its long hood to its dovetail trunk lid and squat lower than before. The side profile, its most defining\
                feature with those slim, pillar-less doors and raked glass, has hardly changed since the first generation.\
                Up front, the CLS grabs the angry race car look of the AMG GT, with a trapezoidal grille and slanted LED headlights.\
                Out back, flush exhaust tips and squinting LED taillights complete this car’s tailored form.",
